		<p>As soon as you enter the Tea Gardern, you get the sense of a restaurant with new beginnings & memories for the entire community to take part. With lots of sunlight and windows, here is a great spot to order a pot of tea, along with a selection our delicious tea sandwiches, and be sure to save room for our English style scones with clotted cream and home-made jam!</p>
		<p>On weekends, enjoy brunch dishes with our tea services, such as eggs Benedict, fluffy omelets, strawberry cheesecake stuffed with french toast, and many more delicious dishes. Guests love that we are a BYO, bring your champagne to make mimosas! Our philosophy is the fresh food idea: the simpler prepared, the better!</p>
		<p>With close to 50 seats upstairs, over 20 on our main floor, and outdoor seating on our patio, itâ€™s a great place for not only your next dining experience but also catered events in house or off premise.</p>
